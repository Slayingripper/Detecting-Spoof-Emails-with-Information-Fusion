## Metrics and Validation 
We need to be able to compare and evaluate our models perfomance as to improve and maintain it. For us to acheive this we need to use
clear and concise methods of collecting and analysing our data. Expanding, validation of our data is key to ensure that the results taken are robust and accurate enough so that proper comparisons can be made. The following section will discuss the metrics used and section ***** will cover the validation of the data.

### Metrics 

Clear and Concise metrics that can be used to for both models which will facilite comparisons between the two. It is of great significance that the metrics comprise of the multiple ascpest as to evaluate the models perfomance eg. Variable Loss etc. and also being clear and simplistic to understand and can be justly compared.
